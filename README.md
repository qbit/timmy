# Timmy - a time tracking XMPP bot
Timmy supports categories and projects. Categories are general purpose containers like 'Meeting' or 'Development'.  Projects are generally things like a project name ( 'Timmy' for example ).

Timmy keeps inserts a start time when it receives the command ( you must have previously added <category> and <project> with the "add project" or "add category" commands ): 
	"start <category> <project>"
